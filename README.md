# Geo.Hackmin Week

**Online, 1-6 March, 2021**

_Just in time for the international Open Data Day, numerous new geo-datasets and corresponding web services of the Swiss Confederation (in particular, from the Federal Office of Topography, swisstopo) will be made available free of charge on 01.03.2021. We are cividi - a civic tech startup developing open urban data platforms - organizing a week of virtual activities open to everyone._
